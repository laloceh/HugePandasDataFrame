Our tutorial is composed by two parts. 

The first parts will be a focus on the data aggregation. 
It is not possible to import all data within a data frame and then to do the aggregation.
You could find several rows by users in the dataset and you are going to show how aggregate our 
400 Million rows to have a dataset aggregated with one row by users. 

In the second part, we are going to continue the processing but this time in order to optimize the 
memory usage with a few transformations.
